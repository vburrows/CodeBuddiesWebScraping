# CodeBuddiesWebScraping
We will practice and learn to use Python to scrape webpage we will designate

So I am sure there is a better way to do this but I am learning Github as I go as well

The file I am currently working on is scraping a yellowpages.com which is business directory. I am looking at classic car dealers in Houston (I dont really need this but it seemed like it would be a useful site to scrape) The name of the current file is "BS4_Study.py"

Something I would like to be able to do:

1. Make a list of 1 directory page stored in a csv file
2. Make a list of all directory pages stored in a csv file
3. sync Pycharm to this github repository (I figure that is a youtube video)
4. create functions that do items 1 & 2
